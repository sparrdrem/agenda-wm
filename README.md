# DremJS Agenda Window Manager
The Window Manager for DremJS, but isolated so anyone can incorporate it into their own project.

## NOTICE: This repository is no longer maintained.
### The latest version of Agenda can be found <a href="https://github.com/sparrdrem/DremJS/">here</a>.
The reason I chose to drop the repository is because it's more work I need to keep track of any time I release a new version of DremJS. Agenda WM is not at all dead - it's very much alive.

## What is Agenda?
Agenda is a basic and light-weight window manager written in JavaScript. Simply copy it to your project, add `<script src="agenda-wm.js" />` to your html file, and replace the `<body>` tag with `<body onload="initAgendaWM()">`

More documentation coming soon
